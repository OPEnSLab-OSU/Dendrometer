## Introduction
The Dendrometer is an ongoing project that strives to enable ecological researchers and/or care-takers of grape plants to be able to effectively measure diurnal fluctuations in grape vines. Such information can be crucial for producing market-ideal grapes, as the shrinkage and growth of the vines are important indicators of when the plant is in need of water.

## Key Features
  - Data is collected and written to both SD and a desired Google Sheet, allowing the system to live on the plant for long durations without human intervention
  - Magnetic encoder ([AS5311](https://ams.com/documents/20143/36005/AS5311_DS000200_2-00.pdf)) has a resolution of ~488nm with an extremely low temperature dependency (ideal for outdoor use).
  - Integration with [Loom](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/Loom), which will allow this device to support plug-and-play functionalities with integrated sensors
